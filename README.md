# Pico2W DualSense 5 Bridge — OLED & LCD Edition

[中文](./README.CN.md)

> Turn a Raspberry Pi Pico2W into a wireless adapter for the DualSense (DS5) controller — with an optional on-board status display: **OLED (black & white)** or **LCD (colour)**.

> **OLED & LCD Edition** is a fork of **[awalol/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle)** (upstream) that adds an optional plug-on status display — **Waveshare Pico-OLED-1.3 (128×64, black & white)** or **Waveshare Pico-LCD-1.3 (240×240, 65K-colour IPS)** — with 12 screens (status, 4-slot multi-controller pairing, lightbar color picker with favorites and effect presets, trigger test, gyro tilt, touchpad, diagnostics, latency telemetry, CPU/clock, BT signal strength, audio VU meters, and a persistent settings menu), plus 4-player multi-dongle support (per-dongle player identity + pairing lock) and a DS5 button-combo soft-reboot. Upstream is the authoritative source for the core bridge firmware; this fork tracks it and layers add-on features on top.

## Display variants — OLED (B&W) vs LCD (colour)

One codebase, two firmwares. Every CI build produces **both** UF2s — flash the one matching the panel on your Pico:

| | **OLED (B&W)** | **LCD (colour)** |
|---|---|---|
| Panel | Waveshare Pico-OLED-1.3 (SH1107, 128×64 mono) | Waveshare Pico-LCD-1.3 (ST7789VW, 240×240 65K-colour IPS) |
| Firmware | `ds5-bridge-oled.uf2` | `ds5-bridge-lcd13.uf2` |
| CMake | (default) | `-DDISPLAY_LCD13=ON` |
| Extras | — | per-player colour theming (P1 blue / P2 red / P3 green / P4 pink), PWM backlight power ladder, 5-way joystick navigation |

Same 12 screens, same A/B (KEY0/KEY1) navigation, same controller shortcuts on both. The headless rule is unchanged: with **no display attached, either firmware boots and runs identically**. LCD bring-up checklist: [`docs/LCD13-TEST-PLAN.md`](./docs/LCD13-TEST-PLAN.md).

## 🛠️ Web Config Tool

**[→ Open the OLED Edition Web Config](https://marcelinevpq.github.io/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web/#config)**

The web tool is a one-stop shop — **no installs, no command line, no `picotool`**. A brand-new Pico 2 W can go from "just out of the box" to fully flashed and configured without ever leaving the browser:

- **Flash Firmware tab** — put the Pico in **BOOTSEL mode**, then click *Connect to Pico* in the browser and *Flash now*. The site bundles the latest release UF2, or you can load a local `.uf2` you've built yourself. Powered by WebUSB.

  > **What is BOOTSEL mode?** It's the Pico's built-in flashing mode. To enter it: press and hold the small white button labeled **BOOTSEL** on the Pico, *then* plug the USB cable in (or, if it's already plugged in, briefly disconnect and reconnect while holding BOOTSEL). The Pico will appear to your computer as a removable drive — that's how you know it's in BOOTSEL mode. After the web tool flashes the firmware, the Pico auto-reboots into normal mode and is ready to use.
- **Config tab** — once the dongle is flashed and reconnected, edit haptics gain, speaker volume, polling rate, audio auto-haptics mode, and the rest of the persistent settings; save to the dongle's flash with one click. Powered by WebHID. **⚠️ Does not work on the native-trigger firmware** — see the note below.
- **Remap tab** — visual button remapper: click a button on a live DualSense diagram to reassign it to any other (the shoulders/triggers float to the corners as labeled glyphs). The map is stored on the dongle and applied before the host sees the report, so it works in every game and on every OS. Powered by WebHID. **⚠️ Does not work on the native-trigger firmware** — see the note below.
- **OLED Preview tab** — pixel-perfect emulation of all 11 OLED screens. Use the in-page KEY0/KEY1 buttons (or the controller's △ / R1 / D-pad when a DualSense is paired) to navigate. Adaptive triggers actually fire on the controller when you cycle the Trigger Test preset.

Works in any Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera). Firefox + Safari don't expose WebHID or WebUSB, so flashing and live config aren't available there — the OLED Preview still renders with mock data.

> **⚠️ Native-trigger firmware (Unreleased) and the WebHID tabs.** To make games on Linux/Proton recognise the dongle as a genuine DualSense and fire **native adaptive triggers** (see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)), the firmware's HID descriptor is now byte-identical to a real DS5 — which meant *un-declaring* the `0xF6`/`0xF7` config reports the browser **Config** and **Remap** tabs depend on. On that firmware those two tabs can't reach the dongle (WebHID refuses undeclared report IDs). **Flash Firmware and OLED Preview still work**, on-dongle OLED config still works, and the same settings can be driven over Linux `hidraw`. Earlier releases are unaffected.

## Overview

This project enables the Raspberry Pi Pico2W to function as a Bluetooth bridge for the DualSense controller, allowing wireless connectivity with enhanced haptics support.

## Features

**Core bridge (from upstream):**

- Full DualSense connectivity via Pico2W
- HD haptics (advanced vibration feedback)
- Wireless Bluetooth bridging
- Adjustable haptic gain via microphone volume
- Configurable LED and disconnection behaviors

**OLED Edition additions:**

- **Native DualSense adaptive triggers in PC games on Linux/Proton — through the dongle.** Games with native DualSense support drive the controller's adaptive triggers wirelessly via the dongle, **1:1 with a directly-wired DualSense**. Requires a Proton carrying the Wine `winebus.sys` #9034 fix (Wine 11 / current Proton-GE) with Steam Input disabled — **no launch option needed** (Wine 11 enables the hidraw native path by default). Works on **both Steam and Heroic** (Epic/GOG). The firmware makes the dongle byte-for-byte indistinguishable from a real DS5 so the game accepts it (full write-up in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)). Trade-off: the browser Config/Remap tabs are disabled on this firmware (see the note above).
- Optional Pico-OLED-1.3 status display with **11 screens** (status, slots, lightbar, trigger test, gyro tilt, touchpad, diagnostics, CPU/clock, RSSI, VU meters, settings)
- **Button remapping** — reassign any of the 16 digital controls (face buttons, D-pad, shoulders/triggers, stick clicks, Create/Options) to any other. Stored on the dongle and applied before the host sees the report, so it works in **every game and OS with no host-side software**; identity (no remap) is the default. Edit it visually in the [web config tool](#️-web-config-tool)'s **Remap tab**, or headlessly via `scripts/remap_test.py`. Persisted in its own flash sector, survives reboot.
- **4-slot persistent multi-controller pairing** — bond up to four DualSenses, switch between them from the OLED, slot 0 reconnects automatically on boot
- **Lightbar color picker** with 4 user favorite slots + breathing / rainbow / fade effect presets
- **Persistent settings menu** for the 8 firmware config fields (haptics gain, speaker volume, polling rate, etc.) with hold-to-confirm Reset and Wipe-all-slots actions
- **OLED idle power ladder** — manual brightness cycle (KEY1 long-press), automatic deep-dim with a small breathing dot at 2 min idle, full display-off at 15 min idle. Wakes instantly on button, controller pair, or input. Real burn-in protection, not just a contrast tweak.
- **Soft-reboot** without unplugging USB via DS5 `PS + Mute` hold (works headless) or **KEY0 + KEY1 held together for 1 s** on the OLED add-on (replaces the older KEY0 double-click gesture, which was easy to fire by accident while paging quickly)
- **Audit pass on the core bridge** — critical stack-overflow fix in the audio path (resolves long-standing "audio stuttering"), security hardening, watchdog, length validation across HID/L2CAP boundaries (see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md))

## 🐧 Linux: native adaptive triggers (Proton)

Getting a game to drive the controller's **adaptive triggers through the dongle** on Linux needs a Proton that carries the Wine `winebus.sys` **#9034** fix. **As of this writing no official Proton-GE release includes it yet** — it's merged upstream but unreleased, and `GE-Proton10-34` (the current release) and earlier do **not** have it. So a build that does is provided: **`GE-Proton-DualSense`** (see [Releases](https://github.com/MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Edition/releases)). Once an official GE-Proton ships the fix, that will work too.

> Why: the #9034 bug suppresses the SDL gamepad device when a hidraw device exists for the same VID/PID, so the pad is seen *everywhere except in-game*. The fix lets the native (trigger-capable) path and a working gamepad coexist.

**One-time setup**

1. **Install the Proton build.** Download `GE-Proton-DualSense.tar.gz` and extract it to:
   - **Steam:** `~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/`
   - **Heroic:** `~/.config/heroic/tools/proton/`

   Then **fully restart Steam** so it detects the new compatibility tool.
2. **Disable Steam Input** so the game talks to the controller natively — Steam → game **Properties → Controller → Disable Steam Input** (or globally: Settings → Controller → turn off PlayStation Controller support).

**Per game**

3. **Force the Proton:** Steam → right-click the game → **Properties → Compatibility → Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool → `GE-Proton-DualSense`**. (Heroic: set the game's *Wine version* to it.)

**No launch option is needed** — Wine 11 enables the hidraw native path by default, so the dongle is handed to the game automatically. Just launch — native adaptive triggers fire through the dongle, 1:1 with a wired DualSense (verified flag-free on Cyberpunk 2077, Uncharted, Spider-Man Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, Avatar, Indiana Jones — and on **both Steam and Heroic**). The game must have **native DualSense support** (XInput-only games give rumble but no adaptive triggers — that's an engine limit, not the dongle). First launch under a new Proton does locale/prefix setup and can sit "Not Responding" for a minute — that's setup, not a crash; let it finish.

### Heroic (Epic / GOG) — same recipe, two extra requirements

Native triggers work identically on Heroic, but non-Steam launchers are sensitive to two host-side things that silently steal the controller:

1. **Fully quit Steam** — a background Steam grabs the DualSense from non-Steam games (or disable Settings → Controller → PlayStation controller support).
2. **No global `PROTON_PREFER_SDL`** — that env var forces the SDL/Xbox path and *suppresses* native triggers. Use it per-game only, as a deliberate generic-pad fallback.

**Launch-option reference**

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PROTON_ENABLE_HIDRAW` | `0x054c/0x0ce6` | *Legacy / optional — **not needed** on Wine 11*, which enables the hidraw native path by default. Harmless if set. Only relevant on older Proton where hidraw was opt-in (but those also lack the #9034 fix, so triggers won't work there anyway). |
| `PROTON_PREFER_SDL` | `1` | *Alternative, input-only.* Forces the SDL gamepad path — gives working input + rumble but as a generic/Xbox pad (**no triggers**). Use only when a game lacks native DualSense support and `ENABLE_HIDRAW` doesn't help. Do **not** combine with `ENABLE_HIDRAW` for trigger games. |
| `PROTON_LOG` | `+hid` | *Diagnostic only* (not for normal play). Writes a HID enumeration trace — Steam lands it at `~/steam-<appid>.log`; Heroic sets `PROTON_LOG_DIR` to your home, so it lands at `~/steam-0.log`. Useful for confirming the game opened the native HID path. |

> **Heroic vs Steam:** Native triggers work on **both** — and neither needs a launch option on Wine 11. Steam: set the runner + disable Steam Input. Heroic: set the runner, **fully quit Steam** (a background Steam steals the pad from non-Steam games), and keep `PROTON_PREFER_SDL` off. Either way the game must natively support DualSense — XInput-only games (e.g. Ghostrunner, Control) give rumble but no adaptive triggers, on any OS.

## Getting Started

### Flashing Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico2W
2. Connect the Pico2W to your computer via USB
3. The device will mount as a USB storage device
4. Drag and drop the .uf2 firmware file onto the device

### Pairing the Controller

1. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode
2. Wait for the Pico2W to detect and connect
3. Once connected, the device will appear on the host system

## Configuration

There are four ways to configure the firmware:

**Web config (recommended, any Chromium-based browser):** open **[DS5 Bridge Config — OLED Edition](https://marcelinevpq.github.io/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web/)** in Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, or Opera (Firefox isn't supported — Mozilla declined WebHID). Click **Connect**, pick the DualSense from the browser dialog, and edit any field with a familiar form UI. The page talks directly to the Pico over WebHID — no driver, no install, no data leaves your machine. Source at [MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web](https://github.com/MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web).

**On-device (OLED add-on present):** use the on-screen **Settings** menu (10th screen). D-pad ▲▼ moves selection, ▶◀ adjusts values, △ saves to flash.

**Terminal CLI (any OS, any browser):** install hidapi, then use `scripts/set_ds5.py`:

```bash
pip install hidapi
scripts/set_ds5.py                            # show current config
scripts/set_ds5.py --auto-haptics fallback    # change a field, persist to flash
scripts/set_ds5.py --speaker-volume -10 --haptics-gain 1.5
scripts/set_ds5.py --slot 2                   # switch active multi-slot pairing
scripts/set_ds5.py --version                  # firmware version
scripts/set_ds5.py --rssi                     # live BT RSSI in dBm
scripts/set_ds5.py --help                     # full flag list
```

The script talks to the firmware over USB HID feature reports `0xF6`/`0xF7`/`0xF8`/`0xF9` — works on Linux, macOS, and Windows in any terminal regardless of which browser you use. Ported from [loteran/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/loteran/DS5Dongle) and extended for this fork's `current_slot` field.

**DualSense controller buttons (legacy fallback, no OLED, no CLI):**

### Microphone volume

Controls haptic gain multiplier. Range: `[1.0 – 2.0]`.

### Speaker mute

Disables LED connection indicator. Takes effect after controller reconnects.

### Microphone mute

Disables silent disconnection behavior.

## Notes

The Pico device will only be visible to the system after the controller is connected

Some behaviors depend on reconnection cycles to take effect

### Low-battery LED indicator

When the connected DualSense reports its battery at or below 10% (and it is not charging), the Pico onboard LED switches from solid-on to a 1 Hz blink so you can see the warning at a glance. The LED returns to solid-on as soon as the controller is plugged in or its reported level rises again. The blink also fires when `disable_pico_led` is set — the warning is treated as critical and overrides the LED-off preference; the LED returns to its disabled (off) state once the battery recovers or the controller starts charging.

To opt out at build time, configure with `-DENABLE_BATT_LED=OFF`. Default is ON.

## DualSense Microphone over Bluetooth

**The DualSense's built-in microphone works over the dongle's Bluetooth pairing** (since v0.6.8). The controller streams its mic as Opus audio; the dongle decodes it and presents it to the host as the standard DualSense USB capture device, so any app (Discord, OBS, in-game voice) can use it like a normal microphone.

This was long believed impossible — earlier versions of this fork documented it as a hard Sony-firmware limitation (and the Linux `hid-playstation` kernel driver still doesn't support it). It turned out to hinge on a single enable bit in the dongle's outbound audio report. **Full credit to [awalol](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle) (upstream) for identifying it.** The corrected investigation log lives in [BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_NOTES.md](./BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_NOTES.md).

**Using it:**

- **On by default.** Pair the controller and the mic begins streaming within a second or two — no game audio required (the dongle keeps the stream alive on its own).
- **Raise the capture volume on the host** — it defaults low. On Linux, find the card with `arecord -l`, then e.g. `amixer -c <DualSense card> sset 'Headset' 90%`. Verify capture with `scripts/mic_diag.sh capture`.
- **Toggle it off to save controller battery** — OLED **Settings → BT Mic**, or the **BT microphone** switch in the [web config tool](#web-config-tool). Always-on mic keeps the DS5's audio subsystem awake, which drains its battery noticeably faster, so disable it if you don't use voice.

**Caveats:**

- Mic audio is **mono** (decoded mono, duplicated across the stereo capture endpoint).
- Toggling off mid-session stops the host feed immediately, but the controller keeps streaming until it next reconnects (there's no known "stop" command); connecting fresh with the toggle off never enables it.
- The OLED **Diagnostics** screen's `Mic in:` counter reads ~100/s while the mic is streaming — a quick way to confirm it's live.
- **Packet-loss concealment:** dropped mic frames (weak BT link, distance, interference) are concealed with Opus PLC so voice stays continuous instead of clicking/cutting out, at a small jitter-buffer latency (~30 ms). The Diag screen's `Mic PLC:` counter climbs only when frames are being concealed — effectively a live link-quality gauge.

## Known Issues

- Overclocking to 320 MHz @ 1.20 V is **required** for stable BT pairing. Dropping voltage to 1.10 V or clock to stock breaks the CYW43 PIO SPI bus and BT stops working. A small heatsink on the RP2350 is recommended for sustained gameplay.
- HD haptics may not fire in every game on Linux + Steam; this is game-side (some titles only send HD-haptic audio under Windows-specific APIs). Tested working in Spider-Man Remastered; not delivered in Ghost of Tsushima — same firmware, same controller.
- **USB 3.0 ports can disrupt pairing** — the controller may get stuck on a solid amber/yellow lightbar and never connect, while the same dongle works fine on a USB 2.0 port. This is RF interference, not a firmware bug; see [USB 3.0 ports & Bluetooth interference](#usb-30-ports--bluetooth-interference) below. (As of v0.6.8 the firmware auto-retries a stalled connection instead of hanging, which recovers many — but not all — marginal cases.)

## USB 3.0 ports & Bluetooth interference

If the dongle works on one port but not another, **try a USB 2.0 port first.** USB 3.0 ports and (especially) USB 3.0 extension cables emit broadband RF noise centered near 2.4 GHz — the same band the dongle's Bluetooth radio uses to talk to the controller. This is a well-documented industry issue (Intel, *"USB 3.0 Radio Frequency Interference Impact on 2.4 GHz Wireless Devices"*), not specific to this firmware. The noise desensitizes the dongle's BT receiver, so the controller can start connecting (amber lightbar) but the link is too noisy to complete — it hangs on yellow.

Mitigations, roughly in order of effectiveness:

1. **Plug the dongle into a USB 2.0 port** (often the simplest fix — many motherboards/cases have both).
2. **Use a short USB 2.0 extension cable** to get the dongle a few inches away from the USB 3.0 ports / metal chassis, improving line-of-sight to the controller. Avoid USB 3.0 extension cables specifically.
3. **Use a powered USB 2.0 hub** plugged into the USB 3.0 port — the hub downshifts the link and adds distance.
4. **Clip a ferrite bead** onto the cable near the dongle.
5. **Keep the controller closer / in line of sight** of the dongle during pairing.

The firmware will keep retrying a stalled connection on its own, so leaving it plugged in for ~10–20 s after the lightbar goes amber may let it recover without a replug.

## Performance / Overclocking

**You don't need to do anything for this — the overclock is baked into the firmware.** When you flash a UF2 from this repo, the Pico 2 W boots at the settings below automatically. There is no separate tool to run, no config file to edit, no fuses to blow.

Baked-in settings:

- **Voltage: 1.20 V** (`vreg_set_voltage(VREG_VOLTAGE_1_20)`)
- **Clock: 320 MHz** (`set_sys_clock_khz(SYS_CLOCK_KHZ, true)`)

Why it's required: at stock clock/voltage the CYW43 PIO SPI bus (the path the firmware uses to talk to the on-board Bluetooth chip) is unreliable and pairing fails. 320 MHz @ 1.20 V is the lowest combination we've verified to produce a stable BT link on this board.

If your device fails to boot a build you compiled yourself (unusual — only relevant when you've changed source), try increasing voltage slightly or lowering the clock in `src/main.cpp`. End users running official UF2 releases should not need to touch this.

A small heatsink on the RP2350 is **recommended for sustained gameplay** but not required for pairing or short sessions.

## Build Instructions

To build the project from source:

1. Install Pico SDK 2.2.0 (or later). The build uses `pico_sdk_import.cmake`.
2. **Pin TinyUSB to 0.20.0** inside the Pico SDK (`$PICO_SDK_PATH/lib/tinyusb`). This project's `tusb_config.h` uses the 4-argument form of `TUD_AUDIO_EP_SIZE`, which is not present in the 0.18.0 version that ships bundled with Pico SDK 2.2.0:
   ```bash
   cd "$PICO_SDK_PATH/lib/tinyusb"
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout 0.20.0
   ```
3. Configure and build with CMake + Ninja (or Make):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/DS5Dongle
   cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPICO_SDK_PATH="$PICO_SDK_PATH"
   cmake --build build --target ds5-bridge
   ```
4. The UF2 lands at `build/ds5-bridge-oled.uf2` — or `build/ds5-bridge-lcd13.uf2` when configured with `-DDISPLAY_LCD13=ON` (colour LCD build). Flash with BOOTSEL as usual.

Build flags worth knowing:

- `-DENABLE_BATT_LED=ON` (default) — blink Pico LED on low DS5 battery.
- `-DENABLE_SERIAL=ON` — route printf to USB CDC for debugging (default OFF; releases UART for production builds).
- `-DPICO_W_BUILD=ON` — build for the original Pico W (drops audio, lowers clock). Default targets Pico 2 W.

## Diagnostics & debug tooling

Two ways to triage bridge issues — on-device via the OLED Diagnostics screen, and host-side via `scripts/mic_diag.sh` (Linux). The host-side path is faster: no screen-switching, no flash cycle, runs while the controller is in active use.

```
# One-shot snapshot — is the dongle on USB? Did ALSA enumerate it? Is the
# capture stream live? Is a controller currently paired?
scripts/mic_diag.sh status

# 3-second arecord on the mic IN endpoint — reports peak / RMS / non-zero
# count so we can tell "stream is silent" from "stream is producing audio".
scripts/mic_diag.sh capture 3

# Same as `status` but in a loop, prints only on state change. Useful for
# catching the exact second pairing completes or audio streams open / close.
scripts/mic_diag.sh watch

# Live read of the firmware's 0xFD vendor feature report (via /dev/hidraw):
# BT input counts + rates, last seen non-0x31 IDs, byte prefixes, AND the
# trigger-flow counters (host 0x02 received / with AllowTriggerFFB set /
# forwarded to BT). bt-trace prints a verdict — "host driver isn't sending
# trigger Allow bits" vs "forwarded but controller didn't actuate" — which
# is what would otherwise need a USB protocol analyzer.
scripts/mic_diag.sh bt-trace
```

Originally written to triage the parked DS5 BT-microphone investigation (see [BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_NOTES.md](./BLUETOOTH_AUDIO_NOTES.md)). The `0xFD` feature report and `bt-trace` decoder now also carry the trigger-flow counters added for [issue #3](https://github.com/MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Edition/issues/3) (missing adaptive trigger tension in some games).

## OLED Display Add-on (optional)

If you plug a [Waveshare Pico-OLED-1.3](#hardware) onto the Pico2W's headers, the firmware drives it automatically as a live status display. No configuration needed — the firmware no-ops gracefully when no OLED is present.

> **LCD too:** everything in this section applies equally to the colour build (`ds5-bridge-lcd13.uf2` + Pico-LCD-1.3) — same screens, same buttons (A = KEY0, B = KEY1), rendered at 240×240 in colour with per-player accent theming. LCD-only extras: B-long-press cycles backlight brightness, the idle power ladder dims and then fully cuts the backlight (dark-room friendly), and the 5-way joystick navigates Settings/Slots/Diagnostics with no controller connected.

### Boot splash (1.5 s on power-on)

Centered firmware version on a blank screen for 1.5 seconds, then jumps to the Status screen.

### Eleven screens, cycled with KEY0 on the add-on

Cycle order: **Status → Slots → Lightbar → Trigger Test → Gyro Tilt → Touchpad → Diagnostics → CPU/Clock → BT Signal → VU Meters → Settings →** wrap. **KEY0 short-press steps forward; KEY1 short-press steps backward** — on *every* screen. Per-screen interactions (cycling the trigger preset, cycling the lightbar mode, navigating the Settings cursor, switching slots) live on the **DualSense controller buttons**, never on KEY0/KEY1, so the two physical buttons on the OLED add-on always mean the same thing.

Every screen also paints **`>`** at the top-left edge (next to KEY0) and **`<`** at the bottom-left edge (next to KEY1) so the on-screen labels physically pair with the buttons.

#### 1. Status

Connection state, paired DualSense BD address, battery % with bar (`+` charging / `*` complete / `!` error), live analog stick positions (each stick box flashes inverse — a black dot on a white box — while its **L3 / R3** is clicked in), D-pad, face buttons (△ ◯ ✕ □), L1/R1, and L2/R2 analog trigger fill bars. The link indicator and battery use small pixel icons. While charging, a `~Nm` estimate of the time to 100% appears next to the battery.

<img src="./assets/oled/oled_sc01.jpg" alt="Status screen on the OLED" width="420">

#### 2. Slots

Persistent 4-slot multi-controller pairing. Browse stored controllers, switch active slot, or wipe a single slot. `>` is the cursor, `*` marks the currently active slot.

<img src="./assets/oled/oled_sc02.jpg" alt="Slots screen on the OLED" width="420">

- **D-pad ▲▼** — move cursor across slots 0–3
- **△** — switch to the cursor slot (disconnect current, reconnect to slot's stored controller)
- **□ hold 1.5 s** — wipe the cursor slot (drops bd_addr + BTstack link key)
- Active slot is persisted; the dongle reconnects to it on next boot

#### 3. Lightbar Color Picker

Tilt the controller on each axis to dial in R / G / B; the firmware sends the resulting color to the DualSense's actual lightbar at 10 Hz, so the lightbar IS the visual preview (the OLED is monochrome).

- Press **△ ◯ ✕ □** on the controller to **save** the current color into favorite slot 0 / 1 / 2 / 3
- Press **R1** on the controller to cycle the mode tag: `[LIVE]` → `[FAV0]` → `[FAV1]` → `[FAV2]` → `[FAV3]` → effects (Breathing / Rainbow / Fade) → back to `[LIVE]`
- Default favorites: Red, Green, Blue, White

#### 4. Trigger Test

Press **△** on the controller to cycle seven adaptive trigger effects applied to both L2 and R2. Pull each trigger to feel the effect.

Cycle order: **Off → Feedback → Weapon → Vibration → Bow → Gallop → Machine Gun → Off …** Effect parameters bitpacked per [dualsensectl](https://github.com/nowrep/dualsensectl)'s reverse-engineering, all at max strength.

#### 5. Gyro Tilt

Live X/Y/Z accelerometer values with a 40×40 crosshair box. The dot tracks the controller's tilt in real time and **sits centered when the controller lies flat** — it's driven by the controller's own per-unit factory IMU calibration (parsed from feature report `0x05`), so the rest position and gain are correct on every controller. Tilting left/right and forward/back moves the dot in the matching direction.

#### 6. Touchpad

Live render of the touchpad surface. Dots appear at current finger positions; the count updates as fingers touch / leave.

#### 7. Diagnostics

Scrollable list of live counters — uptime, BT state, host → BT trigger flow (`host02` / `trig` / `tx`), BT 0x31 input rate, USB audio frames/sec, BT 0x32 packets/sec, and parked mic-investigation counters at the bottom. Controller D-pad ▲/▼ scrolls; tiny `^` / `v` glyphs at the right edge mark "more above/below." Read-only, so no cursor. Useful for verifying the bridge is moving bytes without needing a UART cable.

The same counters are also exported on HID feature report `0xFD` for host-side tooling — see `scripts/mic_diag.sh bt-trace` below.

#### 8. CPU / Clock

Live RP2350 vitals: configured (`Set`) and actually-running (`Real`) system clock measured against the crystal reference, core voltage read back from the regulator, and on-die temperature (256-sample average + slow EMA so the value tracks the real die temp rather than ADC noise).

The same telemetry is also exported on HID feature report `0xFC` for tooling.

#### 9. BT Signal

Live Bluetooth signal strength of the active link, in dBm with a bar. Closer to 0 dBm is stronger; −90 dBm is weak. Includes a qualitative label (Poor / Fair / Good / Excellent).

#### 10. VU Meters

Live peak meters for the speaker and haptic audio paths. Useful for verifying audio routing without the controller being plugged in to a host.

#### 11. Settings

Persistent config editor. D-pad ▲▼ moves the selection, ▶◀ adjusts values, △ saves to flash. Includes the firmware-config fields (haptics gain, speaker volume, inactive timeout, polling rate), the Audio Auto Haptics controls, and two hold-to-confirm actions:

<img src="./assets/oled/oled_sc11.jpg" alt="Settings screen on the OLED" width="420">

- **AutoHap Off / Fallback / Mix / Replace** — selects the Audio Auto Haptics mode. Default `Fallback` fires derived rumble only when the game sends no native haptic data (e.g. Ghost of Tsushima on Linux); games that *do* send native haptics (Spider-Man Remastered) pass through unchanged. `Mix` adds derived on top of native, `Replace` ignores native entirely, `Off` disables.
- **AH Gain N%** — derived-signal gain, 0–200 % in 10 % steps. Default 100 %.
- **AH LP 80/160/250/400 Hz** — low-pass cutoff applied to the speaker audio before envelope follow. Lower = more sub-bass, higher = more presence. Default 160 Hz.
- **Reset to defaults** — hold △ for 2 s to revert all config fields
- **Wipe all slots** — hold △ for 2 s to drop all 4 paired controllers + all BTstack link keys

### Button reference

The two physical buttons on the OLED add-on are **strictly navigation**:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **KEY0** short-press | Next screen (forward) |
| **KEY1** short-press | Previous screen (backward) |
| **KEY1** long-press (≥ 1.5 s) | Cycle OLED brightness level |
| **KEY0 + KEY1** held together ≥ 1 s | `watchdog_reboot` — soft-reboot without unplugging USB |

Per-screen state changes (cycling the trigger preset, cycling the lightbar mode, navigating Settings, switching slots, saving colors to favorite slots) all happen on the **DualSense controller buttons** — never on KEY0 / KEY1 — so the two physical buttons always mean the same thing across every screen. See each screen's section above for which controller button does what.

### Pinout (standard Waveshare Pico HAT layout)

| Function | GPIO |
|---|---|
| MOSI | 11 |
| SCK  | 10 |
| CS   | 9  |
| DC   | 8  |
| RST  | 12 |
| KEY0 | 15 |
| KEY1 | 17 |

### Soft-reboot recovery

Two ways to reboot the dongle without unplugging USB — handy if pairing gets stuck or you want a clean state:

- **OLED KEY0 + KEY1 held simultaneously for ≥ 1 s** → `watchdog_reboot`. Replaces the older "KEY0 double-click" gesture from earlier versions, since rapid forward-navigation kept tripping the double-click timer by accident.
- **DualSense `PS + Mute` held for 2 seconds** → `watchdog_reboot` (works whether or not the OLED is attached — headless backup).

## Acknowledgements

Some features and design ideas in this fork are borrowed from other forks of upstream, with credit:

- **[zurce/DS5Dongle-OLED](https://github.com/zurce/DS5Dongle-OLED)** — pixel-art icons in the OLED status header (visual approach), the "hold for factory reset" UX pattern used by the Settings screen's "Reset to defaults" item (hold △ for 2 s to confirm), and the multi-slot persistent BT pairing system on the new Slots screen (4 bonded controllers, D-pad to navigate, △ to switch slots, □ hold to wipe a slot, plus "Wipe all slots" in the Settings menu).
- **[loteran/DS5Dongle](https://github.com/loteran/DS5Dongle)** — independent rediscovery of the upstream `3a31bd7` regression that broke speaker / HD haptic output (commit `c7a8d3c`); the fix in our `src/audio.cpp` restores the same SetStateData sub-report. Also the source of the Audio Auto Haptics DSP (1-pole LP + envelope follower, see Settings → Auto Haptics) and the "don't sync USB-side UAC1 volume to the persistent config" fix.
- **[SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge](https://github.com/SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge)** — a sibling Pico DualSense bridge. The button-remapping apply logic and digital-control set in `src/remap.{h,cpp}` are ported from it. Its audio architecture (on-device Opus encoding vs an optional host-encoding companion app) was also the reference for diagnosing our speaker-cadence ("warble") work. Thanks for the groundwork.
- **[awalol/ds5dongle-config-web](https://github.com/awalol/ds5dongle-config-web)** — base for our forked web config app at [MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web](https://github.com/MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Config-Web). The fork adapts upstream's 13-byte Config_body layout to our 19-byte one and adds UI for our additions (multi-slot pairing, Auto Haptics).
